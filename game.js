/* ========================================
   SCOOTER SORT
   SECURITYPLUS FINANCIAL LITERACY GAME
   Ages 7-10

   CORE LESSON (rebuilt again 2026-09-10, drag rework): needs vs. wants.
   NEED and WANT are the two lanes, always rolling continuously down their
   own side of the road (left/right) - that's just the road's own signage,
   always there. The actual question is a single word that pops up at the
   top of the screen and stays put ("Candy", "Bus Fare", "Kite"...). The
   player DRAGS the scooter left or right, into whichever lane matches -
   wherever it's sitting when time runs out is the answer. Correct = a
   star. Wrong = a gentle on-screen correction - no penalty, no icons, no
   money math.

   This replaces the previous version, where a small icon card physically
   traveled down the center of the road toward the scooter and the scooter
   only jumped between two fixed spots on tap. Kayla's feedback: the
   scooter needs to be genuinely steerable (drag, not tap-to-jump), the
   question should be plain words instead of an icon, and NEED/WANT
   themselves should be the moving/rolling part of the road rather than a
   fixed label - and the "my prize goal" progress bar should go away in
   favor of just watching the star count go up.

   DIFFICULTY BUMP (2026-09-16): which physical side (left/right) NEED and
   WANT land on is now randomized fresh for every single item, instead of
   NEED always being left and WANT always being right. This stops kids
   from just memorizing "left = need" instead of actually reading the
   word each time. See needIsOnLeftThisItem, re-rolled once per item in
   showSignsForCurrentItem().

/* ================= SHARED SCENERY CAMERA (2026-09-23, per Kayla) =================
   Every piece of ambient scenery (trees, flowers/grass patches, the
   billboard/branch landmarks, and the yellow center-line dashes) is now
   driven by ONE rigid world: each piece has a fixed spot in the world at
   some depth, and a single camera rolls forward through that world at a
   constant speed (SCENE_CAMERA_SPEED). Screen position and size are then
   pure perspective of that depth - y = vanishing point + k/depth, and
   size/sideways offset scale by 1/depth - with the vanishing point read
   straight off the road art's own edges (where the two road edges meet).

   Why: the old version eased each piece's screen position with its own
   t*t curve from its own spawn time (and trees, flowers, dashes and
   landmarks all had different trip lengths). In world terms that meant a
   freshly spawned piece was racing forward while an older one ahead of it
   had nearly stopped - so a billboard that popped up behind a tree could
   visibly close most of the gap and "catch up" to it, which read as the
   scenery moving on its own instead of the scooter moving through it.
   With one shared depth clock, a thing behind can never gain on a thing
   ahead, everything at the same distance moves at the same speed, and
   everything radiates out from the same vanishing point as the road. */

/* ================= AMBIENT BACKGROUND MOTION =================
   2026-09-16 perspective pass. Feedback from a playtest: with only the
   NEED/WANT signs growing as they travel, and literally everything else
   in the scene (road, grass, trees) sitting frozen, the signs read as
   objects being thrown AT the player rather than the player driving
   forward down a road - there was nothing else on screen confirming "the
   world is moving," so the signs had no context.

   Fix: two continuous, purely decorative spawners - roadside trees and
   center-line dashes - that plant something small up at the hill crest
   and travel/grow it down toward the bottom using the exact same
   easeInPerspective curve already used for the signs (see positionRoadSign
   above). With the scenery itself now receding-to-approaching in sync
   with the signs, the whole scene reads as one moving world instead of
   objects flying at the camera.

   Both run forever from page load, independent of gameRunning/round state
   - same as the sun/cloud drift already did - so the road already feels
   alive behind the start screen, tutorial, and finish screen, not just

// edge at that row (roadLeftEdgeX, same formula the signs use to stay ON
// the pavement) plus an outward margin that grows the deeper the tree
// gets - so trees are always planted a clear gap out into the grass
// instead of hugging the shoulder (which read as "static," like they'd
// been dropped right next to the road rather than passing scenery).
// Both the travel distance and outward margin deliberately run well past
// the visible frame (GROUND_Y past 100%, OUTSET_NEAR far past the edge)
// so a tree is fully clipped out of view by #roadScene's overflow:hidden
// before it's ever removed from the DOM - it slides all the way off
// instead of popping away while still on screen.
// Matches GROUND_BAND_TOP (the hill line, 24.5829% + 8.7246% - hills were
// slid up in style.css to meet the fixed road position, so this moved up
// with them) - trees now start right where the grass does instead of
// fading in a few points higher, which used to read as trees growing in
// over the hill artwork itself rather than out of the grass beside the
// road.

// trees actually out in the field. Skewed so it can only ever push a tree

/* ================= SIDE-ON STREET BUILDINGS (2026-10-07, per Kayla) =================
   Buildings now line the street like the mockup: each one is a WALL that
   runs along the road (parallel to it), instead of a flat sprite facing the
   player. The art is drawn flat, straight-on (an elevation of the wall that
   faces the road) and this code bends it into perspective.

   How: each building occupies a stretch of the road in the shared scenery
   camera's world - from depth d0 (its near end) to d1 = d0 + length. Its
   four screen corners come straight from the same perspective formulas as
   everything else (ground row = sceneYAtDepth, sideways offset and height
   shrink by 1/depth), and one CSS matrix3d (a perspective "corner pin")
   warps the flat image onto those four corners. Because the wall is a true
   plane in the same world, the warp is exact, not an approximation.

   Each side of the road gets a continuous row: the next building is placed
   a small random gap behind the last one, so the street fills up like the
   mockup. The image is cropped at the hill crest (so buildings slide out
   from behind the hill like the road does) and just before the camera.

   Art rules: flat elevation (no perspective drawn in), ground line at the
   bottom of the artboard. On the left side the image's LEFT edge is the
   near end; on the right side its RIGHT edge is - so nothing is mirrored and
   text on signs reads correctly on both sides.

   Tuning knobs:
   - SCENE_PCT_PER_DEPTH_UNIT: how "long" one depth unit of road is, in the
     same units as heights/outsets (% of scene width at near size). Bigger =
     buildings look shorter along the road (more squashed); smaller = longer.
   - SIDE_BUILDING_OUTSET (+ jitter): how far back from the curb the walls stand.
   - heightNear per asset: building height (% of scene width at near size).
   - SIDE_BUILDING_GAP_MIN/MAX: space between neighbouring buildings (depth units). */

// flight at once - a proper dashed line, not one dash at a time.

// continuously, so the ground itself reads as moving instead of just the

// modulo offset per tile, one with a recycle-to-the-back queue - and both
// let the whole chain drift arbitrarily far from the visible band over
// time, which either opened a gap that only "snapped" shut once a full
// cycle had elapsed, or eventually recycled tiles to positions that were
// themselves already off past the bottom, permanently emptying the
// visible band). Instead there's a single small, BOUNDED scroll amount
// (0 up to one light+dark pair's height, then it wraps) that says how far
// into the current pair we are, and every frame the visible sequence of
// tiles is walked fresh from that - light, dark, light, dark... - filling
// downward from the hill line until past the bottom of the frame. A small
// reusable pool of <img> elements is repositioned/retyped to match; any

/* ================= TUTORIAL =================
   A short, two-step spotlight walkthrough offered from the start screen
   (2026-09-16 spotlight rework):

   Step 1 (right side) - a demo item is already sitting in the item
   popup; the spotlight dims everything except that popup while the text
   explains "road signs will appear with everyday items."

   Clicking Next lets the NEED/WANT signs travel partway down the road on
   their own (runTutorialTravelToPause), then freezes them there.

   Step 2 (left side) - the spotlight moves to the two paused signs while
   the text explains sorting the item and steering into the right lane.

   Clicking "Try It!" resumes that exact same travel from exactly where
   it paused (beginTutorialDemoCatch, via roadSignResumeOffsetMs) and
   makes the scooter interactive, so the player gets one live practice
   catch - reusing the exact same drag/tap/animate/catch code as the real
   game (see isTutorialDemo in resolveItem/resolveTutorialDemoItem) -
   before startRealGame() kicks off round 1 for real.

   "Skip tutorial" jumps straight to startRealGame() from either step. */

// pass) so there's more room left to travel - and therefore more time to
// think - once step 2 resumes them. Matched to the EASED position, not
// raw elapsed time, since easeInPerspective's t*t curve means "some
// fraction of the travel time" would only look about a quarter as far
// down (the signs start slow and rush at the end). Solving eased(t) =
